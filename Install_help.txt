To use AllToPdf with all features you will need PdfCreator to be installed first.

The PDFCreator-1_7_1_setup_mod.exe file included in that zip file, is the right one to install.
It will insure no future problem with updated versions.

When installing PDFCreator-1_7_1, you will see a warning, don't care 
	just ignore that warning and continue the installation.



Good usage...
