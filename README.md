# AllToPdf  / TousEnPdf
Application developped with PowerBasic 10.3 

to convert files to Pdf;

to collect and organize the Pdf files;

to scan to Pdf.

The full features will need Pdfcreator to be installed, 

if not the limited features only support Text; Images and Pdf files


To insure the conversion of all type of files you have created on your pc , PdfCreator is needed.
if you already have that software installed and if it version is > 1.9.5 the full features will not work!

The best version to work with is 1.7.1, you can find a modified version here.

That PDFCreator-1_7_1_setup_mod.exe file found here, is the right one to install.
It will insure no future problem asking for updated versions. It will avoid new updates.
Done making fake url connection

When installing PDFCreator-1_7_1, you will see a warning, don't care, it's just that fake url connection not succeeding,
	just ignore that warning and continue the installation.



Good usage...
